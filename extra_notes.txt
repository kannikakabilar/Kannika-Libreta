From Chebyshevâ€™s theorem, we know that:
- At least 75% of the data must lie within 2 standard deviations from the mean.
- At least 88.89% of the data must lie within 3 standard deviations from the mean.


Fleury's Algorithm is used to display the Euler path or Euler circuit from a given graph.
Eulerian Path is a trail in a finite graph that visits every edge exactly once (allowing for revisiting vertices).
Eulerian Circuit is an Eulerian Path that starts and ends on the same vertex.

Steps to implement a Fleury's Algorithm
1) Make sure the graph has either 0 or 2 odd vertices.
2) If there are 0 odd vertices, start anywhere. If there are 2 odd vertices, start at one of them.
3) Follow edges one at a time. If you have a choice between a bridge (only edge making the vertex connected to the graph) and a non-bridge, always choose the non-bridge.
4) Stop when you run out of edges.
